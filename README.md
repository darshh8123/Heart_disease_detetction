# Heart Disease Detection using Logistic Regression

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health-related features.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of medical attributes (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.), the goal is to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease (1) or not (0).

##  Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall
- Predicting based on the input

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
